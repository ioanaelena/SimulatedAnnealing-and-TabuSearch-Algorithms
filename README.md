# SimulatedAnnealing-and-TabuSearch-Algorithms
I have implemented the Simulated Annealing algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Tabu Search algorithm for the Knapsack Problem. I have attached the documentation where I describe the experiments conducted on various instances using these algorithms.
